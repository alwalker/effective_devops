* COBIT's tenants VS Agile's. Particularly "covering end to end"
* Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows and How Complex Systems Fail by Dr. Richard Cook and The Machine That Changed the World
* Definition of lean vs agile

	```the definition of Lean as the maximization of customer value and minimization of waste.```
* Agile doesn't say anything about quality or effectiveness of work
* CI is real (re: Deloitte's 3 day merges)
* CICD/CD is still dumb
* I miss retrospectives
* That's a new definition for Configuration Management to me

	```we define configuration management as the process of identifying, managing, monitoring, and auditing a product through its entire lifecycle, including the processes, documentation, people, tools, software, and systems involved.```
