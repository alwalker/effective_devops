* Starting off with a banger!

    ```When we donâ€™t understand our current position or direction, applying acceleration leads to unexpected outcomes with potentially negative impact.```

* `Repair understanding within the scope of the devops compact` I like the idea that tool reinforce roles. More than just "we meet at CICD"?
* Compliance can dictate standards. This is huge! (bridgestone lifecycle of records)

    ```Tools do not fix broken cultures; tools expose and exacerbate existing conditions in environments.```
* As does agile processes or a good PM
* I would add security notifications and fix versions to the list of factors for picking a tool
* I like the idea of bullshit terminology like Chef avoiding conflict with existing/generic terminology 
* Too many wiki's...lol
* Tool retrospectives? I can dig it
* Make sure your devs can run your tools
* This doesn't get asked enough

    `How will you handle it if the automation you create breaks?`
