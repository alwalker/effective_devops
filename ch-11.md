## Chapter 11
* I like that it points out the value of self hosting your shit
* IaC artifact repositories? 
* "Monitoring and Alerting are often confused" -> THAT'S BECAUSE NEW TOOLS ARE SHIT
* Thoughts on `metrics-catalog`?
* You can get metrics from logs
* I like the alerting break down
* But it doesn't mention SLO's
* OpsWeekly sleep tracking is creepy
* Alert fatigue is real
