* I like that it calls out specialization/not wearing all the hats as you grow

	```In addition to being totally unrealistic, this concept of a devops engineer doesnâ€™t scale well. It might be necessary to have the developers deploying the code and maintaining the infrastructure in the early days of an organization, but as a company matures and grows, it makes sense to have people become more specialized in their job roles.```

* "Devops Means Doing All the Work with Half the People" lol
* I don't know about collaboration but I like pointing out transparency and understanding

	```Automation may make work faster, but in order to be most effective it must also increase transparency, collaboration, and understanding.```

* Why the root cause hate? That should also apply to RCA
	```In a blameless culture or a learning organization, a human error is seen as a starting point rather than an ending one, sparking a discussion on the context surrounding the decision and why it made sense at the time.```
