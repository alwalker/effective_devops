## Chapter 9
* Wait the junior dev knew how to stand up a VM?
* Affinity is inter team collaboration?
* I like this quote because engineering often does whatever they fuck they want. Either building products no one wants or wasting time with "upgrades" that don't give anything of value. 

```It is important that the teamâ€™s values not be in conflict with either overall organizational or company-wide values or with the individual values of team members.```

* Culture fit is anti pattern
* Who knows 150 people?
* boot camps/rotations sound awesome
* I feel like the concept of slack is completely absent from SCRUM

## Chapter 10
* ops less valuable than devs: ACS->deloitte experience
* high quality swag, really?
