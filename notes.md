```All Cents employees and functions are valued; no one is more or less important than another. There is no "that's not my job" mentality because there are times when each of us gets our hands dirty and does whatever needs to be done. Cross-functional decision-making and collaboration is key to our culture, and we empower employees to challenge and disagree with each other no matter their title. This is our guiding principle ‘Act Like an Owner’, and we believe it’s key to discovering the best solutions for our customers.```

* Self-disclosure is just transparency?
* Work/life and off hours just leaves out the option of staffing correctly
* On call, put the ALL the devs as T3
* Email and reply all is great
